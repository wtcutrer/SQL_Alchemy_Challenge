## Instructions

### Part 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

#### Step 1: Precipitation Analysis

* Start by finding the most recent date in the data set.
* Using this date, retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 preceding months of data. Note you do not pass in the date as a variable to your query.
* Select only the date and prcp values.
* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
* Sort the DataFrame values by date.
* Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.
* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

#### Step 2: Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
* Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?).
* List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
* Which station id has the highest number of observations?
* Using the most active station id, calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperature.
* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
* Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.
* Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station.
* Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12.
* Close out your session.

#### Step 3: Climate App
Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

List all routes that are available.

* /api/v1.0/precipitation
  * Convert the query results to a dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.
  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* /api/v1.0/stations
  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
  
* /api/v1.0/tobs
  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.
  * Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.

* /api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>
  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.
  * When given the start only, calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.
  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for dates between the start and end date inclusive.
